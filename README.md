# Cryptography Programming Project README

## Introduction
This Java program offers a customizable encryption tool for securing messages using a user-provided keyword. It facilitates the encryption process by converting letters to their corresponding two-digit representations and rearranging them based on the alphabetical order of the keyword.

## Code Structure and Documentation
The program comprises the following classes:

- MessageEncryptor: The main class responsible for executing the encryption process. It handles user input, generates matrices, rearranges matrix order, and prints the encrypted message.
- Each method within the MessageEncryptor class is documented extensively to clarify its purpose and functionality.

## How to Compile and Run the Program
- Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Download or clone the repository containing the Java files.
- Open your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- Create a new Java project or open an existing one.
- Add the Java file (MessageEncryptor.java) to your project.
- Make sure the file is included in the source package.
- Compile the program by selecting "Build" or "Clean and Build" in your IDE.
- After compilation, right-click on the project and select "Run" or use the corresponding shortcut to execute the program.
- The program will prompt you to enter a message and a keyword for encryption.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the encryption process and view the encrypted message.
